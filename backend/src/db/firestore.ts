/**
 * FIRESTORE DRIVER
 * ================
 * Loads every collection into memory on boot and writes changes back.
 *
 * Why a snapshot rather than per-request reads: the whole app reads through a
 * synchronous `getDb()` in 33 places across the route files. Making each of
 * those an awaited Firestore query would be a rewrite of every handler, and
 * would also turn one page load into dozens of billed reads. For a programme
 * sized in hundreds of sellers the entire dataset is a few hundred kilobytes,
 * so holding it in memory is both simpler and far cheaper.
 *
 * Writes are DIFFED, not blanket. Only documents that actually changed are
 * sent, batched, and coalesced over 400ms — otherwise a single order update
 * would rewrite every seller and burn the free-tier write quota.
 *
 * >>> THE LIMITATION, STATED PLAINLY <<<
 * This is correct for ONE server process. If you ever run two instances (Cloud
 * Run autoscaling, two dynos), each holds its own snapshot and they will
 * overwrite each other. At that point the fix is to convert the route handlers
 * to async per-document reads. Until then, pin the deployment to a single
 * instance — `--max-instances=1` on Cloud Run.

 * in Firestore untouched, so restoring this entry is the whole rollback.

 * THE DEAD-MAN'S SWITCH
 * =====================
 * On 10 September 2026 every seller and every product vanished from Firestore:
 * six real women and thirteen listings, deleted in one batch because something
 * handed `persistDiff` an in-memory database with those two arrays empty. The
 * diff did exactly what it is written to do. Nothing was wrong with it, and
 * that is the problem - a whole collection disappearing is indistinguishable
 * here from a legitimate edit.
 *
 * They were recovered only because Firestore keeps one hour of version history
 * even with point-in-time recovery disabled. An hour later there would have
 * been nothing to recover.
 *
 * So: no single write may take out more than half a collection. Removing one
 * product of twenty-four is ordinary; removing twenty of them is not something
 * this application ever legitimately does in one step.
 *
 * `before > 5` keeps the rule out of the way of genuinely small collections,
 * where "half" is one or two documents and clearing them is routine. A seeded
 * database with three sellers can still be emptied.

 * marked as saved: the next diff saw nothing new, nothing was ever resent,
 * and the change lived in memory only until the next start threw it away.
 * Now a failed batch leaves its documents looking unsaved, and the next call
 * sends them again. Throws when a commit fails; store.ts retries.
