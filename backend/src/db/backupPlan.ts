 * rescued six sellers on 10 September 2026. The backup is instead a copy into
 * separate free Firebase and Cloudinary accounts, and this file decides what
 * that copy does. scripts/backup.ts does the reading and writing.
 *
 * Nothing here ever writes to the live project. It is read, once per run.

 * those minutes would have faithfully deleted its own copy of six women. So a
 * live project that has shrunk that far since the backup was taken is treated
 * as the problem, and the backup is left as the evidence.
