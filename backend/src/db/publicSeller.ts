/**
 * THE ONLY SHAPE OF A SELLER THAT LEAVES THE API UNAUTHENTICATED.
 *
 * Built field by field rather than by deleting the private ones. The product
 * page used to return her whole record - phone, admin notices, block reason,
 * her digital-readiness answers - while a comment elsewhere promised her
 * number was on no public endpoint. A deny-list cannot keep that promise: it
 * is only as current as the last person who remembered to extend it.
 *
 * What is here, and why each is public:
 *  - who and where: name, photo, shop, SMB ID, village - what a buyer is
 *    choosing between, and what the law wants beside a food listing.
 *  - delivery terms and pincodes - checkout needs them to price and warn.
 *  - UPI ID, QR image and whether it is set up - the thing a buyer pays to.
 *
 * No rating: sellers are not rated, their products are (see Review).
 *
 * Her phone number is NOT here. A buyer gets it on their own order, from the
 * moment the order exists (see GET /orders/:id), and nowhere else.
